\item
  The year of 2015 has left a profound impact on the nation. This was
  felt on December 2, 2015, when two Islamic extremists opened fire on a
  Christmas party and left 14 dead, and 22 wounded.
\item
  Victims of the tragedy rely on the work of emergency response
  personnel, such as firefighters and police officers, to provide them
  with the life-saving treatment they need following such devastating
  attacks.
\item
  Unfortunately, active shooter incidents delay the response time
  necessary to first action and effectively save their lives from
  preventable deaths. Few studies have been done to investigate the
  causes of death in such tragedies.
\item
  However, the closest comparable data present to analyze such active
  shooter incidents comes from military examples from the field of
  battle open gunfire.
\item
  The most preventable causes of death experienced by these veterans are
  extremity wound hemorrhage and airway obstruction. TCCC has been shown
  to save lives on the battlefield with basic training in \ldots{}
\item
  Civilian personnel in the public eye are already taught basic first
  aid, CPR, and automated external defribillators (AEDs) but this is
  hardly effective in the event of a traumatic scenario
\item
  Incorporating this training into civilian life, could provide the
  necessary knowledge and save a preventable death
\end{itemize}
