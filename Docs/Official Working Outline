•	Increasing amounts of global tragedies- terrorist attacks, natural disasters, mass homicides
•	Few studies have been done to investigate into the leading cause of death 
•	However, their scenarios are most comparable to those of military combat wounds
•	On the battlefield, survival of these military personnel are dependent upon response from those with them in combat, the first responders
•	TCCC has been shown to directly increase the survival rate from battlefield injuries by basic training and knowledge of hemorrhage and airway care by decreasing the time for treatment
•	With the continued emerging tragedies, civilians rely upon the response of emergency medical services (EMS)
•	The national standard for EMS response time is 8 minutes
•	Exsanguination and respiratory failure often occur within the first 4*** minutes of injury
•	Even with EMS working optimally, their fastest response would not be enough to save the injured victims’ lives
•	With basic training in life saving measures, civilians would be able to recognize and address life threatening injuries long before EMS arrives
