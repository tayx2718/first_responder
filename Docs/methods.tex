\item
  Participants of the study were obtained as volunteers from the city of
  Westminster
\item
  Laypeople include Nursing grads and undergrads, Teachers, city
  workers, security guards, and students
\item
  Teachers, city workers, security guards and students were randomly
  placed into 2 groups: trained individuals and untrained individuals
\item
  Medically trained personnel include firefighters, who are pre-trained
  in disaster scenario in EMS training
\item
  Trained individuals were given a 2-hour TCCC training overview 6 weeks
  prior to the experiment
\item
  Test participants were pre-screened about their basic knowledge of
  disaster scenario, with questions including ``What is the primary
  cause of death in population ages 1-44?'', ``What do you think is the
  standard response time when 911 is called?'', and ``What is your
  primary concern immediately following a disaster or emergency
  situation''.
\item
  Every group was brought individually into a room with the chief of
  police, who informed them of the situation: At the mall with friends
  when a magnitude 7 earthquake strikes. There will be debris on the
  ground and light will be limited. You are tasked with assessing the
  situation and responding.
\item
  The room was situated to simulate a major earthquake with debris and
  lighting problems with 4 victims: 1 deceased, 1 arterial bleeding, 1
  unconscious but breathing, and 1 healthy individual.
\item
  The participants 1st action times and time to solution were recorded
  by an observer playing a victim's friend.
\item
  They were graded based off prewritten sheets with questions as follows
  :
\item
  Data was recorded per each group. Average times of trained, untrained,
  and professionally trained individuals were compared to both the
  arterial bleeding and airway stations
